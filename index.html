            <p>Game release dates 2023: all the PC, PS5, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch release dates</p>
            <p>It’s looking like a banner year for the industry in terms of high quality releases, so a 2023 game release dates planner is sure going to come in handy. Even though everyone is looking to titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, there’s just so much to look forward to already. 
                We’ll update this page when dates change. If any of the 2023 release dates slip due to any reason, we’ll let you know here. Moreover, if we’ve covered the game with a preview, video, or anything else, we’ll link to it so you can get an early idea of how it’s shaking up. The date this page was last updated will be at the very bottom of the page.</p>

                <p>The best PSVR2 games | Reviewing the best PlayStation VR2 games so far</p>
                <p>We’ve been lucky enough to be spending the last few weeks in virtual reality, and a list of the best PSVR2 games so far have been on our minds. It’s a massive launch, with some interesting titles that could be described more as experiences, lots of older titles that have been updated with features only the PlayStation VR2 can boast, and even some brand new exclusive titles.

                    This list, while not exhaustive, is based on what we’ve played here at GodisaGeek. There’s some genuine classics on this list of best PSVR2 games already, with two of my personal favourite titles being re-upped for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR2, so without further ado, let’s get to the list. Oh and since we know that people love review scores, while these aren’t our traditional full scored reviews, we’ve slapped a score at the end of each game, just to make people happy. Aren’t we nice?</p>
